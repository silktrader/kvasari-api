KVasari's API serves the narcissistic needs of visual artists, allowing them to upload their artwork, as well as receive and formulate feedback.

== Features

Users can *add, remove and edit their artworks*, along with their metadata.

Artists can edit basic details about their creative selves, *comment* others` artworks in textual form, or leave *graphical reactions*.

Additionally, the application's participants can *follow* their peers, or possibly *ban* them from interactions.

A convenient *stream of paginated artworks* conceived by followed peers is equally available.

== Requirements

*Go 1.19*, or above, is required.

KVasari depends on the following libraries:

* https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter[httprouter]
* https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3[go-sqlite3]
* https://github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation[ozzo-validation]
* https://github.com/gofrs/uuid[uuid]

I developed the project on a _Windows_ box, through _WSL2_, with _Goland_, lots of love and the occasional curse.

=== SQLite Alternatives
[CAUTION]
--
`go-sqlite3` mandates the presence of GCC, and the need for setting the environment variable `CGO_ENABLED=1`. On a Windows machine, configuring this additional compilation step can be tiresome.
--

[https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite]`modernc.org/sqlite` is a valid alternative to `go-sqlite3`, which doesn't depend on *CGO*, thus doesn't require pre-compilation.

Its performance doesn't match `go-sqlite3`, but for light loads that isn't a concern: https://datastation.multiprocess.io/blog/2022-05-12-sqlite-in-go-with-and-without-cgo.html[Benchmark Comparison]

== Build

Run `go build ./cmd/webapi/` and üôè.

== Docker

Run the container with:

`docker run --name kvasari-api -u 1000:1000 -d -p 3000:3000 kvasari-api`

Pick an adequate user ID and port to serve from.
