        Performs a simplistic authentication attempt, returning the user ID and status on success. Passwords aren't checked; only mere user existence is verified.

        Ideally the response would contain access and refresh JWT tokens, with adequate claims.

        The endpoint doesn't create new users, but mandates that action to another route.

      description: |-
        Summarises all the user's recent activity: artworks are fetched, in reverse chronological order, by the dozen.
        With the purpose of building a continuous stream, users are expected to make multiple requests to this endpoint, with changing timestamps, to obtain an ever expanding view of previously uploaded artworks.
        The "since" timestamp signals the earliest time point reached, whence the next dozen artworks, in reverse chronological order, will be provided.
        The "latest" timestamp indicates the current user time, which allows the server to communicate artworks uploaded after that moment, as well as deleted artworks' IDs, which may have been included in previous responses.
    parameters:
      - $ref: "#/components/parameters/UserAlias"
